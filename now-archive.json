Over winter break I travelled with my family to <a href=\"https://substack.com/@benpomeranz/p-182236187\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vietnam</a>, and then attended my first ever <a href=\"https://meetings.ams.org/math/jmm2026/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/55179\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JMM</a>. From there, I was off to Pittsburgh where I stayed at the nicest institution the city has to offer. I did my new outdoor experience of the month, which was learning how to ski (ish ish ish) in the North Country of New York. In a shocking conclusion, I watched live what will surely be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DgjDi774FI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the craziest sports feat I ever see in person</a> on my Chicagoan grandmother's 95th birthday. <br> And now I'm in Providence, and there is no place I'd rather be.",
