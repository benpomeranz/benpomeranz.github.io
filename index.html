    <h1>Ben Pomeranz Made a Website</h1>
    <p>I do not do web dev. I have a <a href="https://benpomeranz.substack.com/"target="_blank">blog</a> that's not half bad, but only because it's more than three quarters empty.<p></p>
    <p>Also, here's a crazy fact: for any complex number $z_0$, there is a sequence of complex numbers $(z_n)$ where $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}z_n = 0$ such that $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}e^{\frac{1}{z_n}} = z_0$$</p>
    <p> Additionally, here's an art deco looking image: it comes from exploring the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12458"target="_blank">"Chips Taking Game"</a>, which involves no snack stealing.</p>

    <p> Finally, here's a photo of me so you can clarify whether this is the website of <em>the</em> Ben Pomeranz who you're trying to Google, though I'd think it's already obvious one way or the other. </p>

    <p> If you were looking for the website of Ben Pomeranz the Slovakian Mountain and now are certain this is the right place, it's not.</p>
